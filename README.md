# Clock
To use this you'll need to edit the "sqlConnect.php" within the admin folder to set the connection to your database.

In the database you'll need a table called "clock" with these colloms: 

Name        |    Type
------------|------------------------
countTime   |    Time
timeStamp   |    Time
show        |    int(1)
